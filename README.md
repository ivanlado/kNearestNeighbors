# kNearestNeighbors
Several versions for kNearestNeighbors algorithm
This kNearestNeighbors algorithm is designed for only binary labels: For a given input value, the algorithm outputs whether it is likely to have either the true (1) or false(0) label.
The given example dataset are the marks of 100 students on 2 middle term exams. The algorithm predicts, taking into account the label for each student (whether they have passed or nor the end term exam), the label for a given input (2 marks).


## 1st version
The basic kNearestNeighbors algorithm

## 2nd version (soon)
The kNearestNeighbors algorithm is improved:

* Features are scalled
* Nearest neighbours importance is weighted according to its distance
